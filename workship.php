    Worship is an act of religious devotion usually directed towards a deity. For many, worship is not about an emotion, it is more about a recognition of a God. An act of worship may be performed individually, in an informal or formal group, or by a designated leader. Such acts may involve honoring.

<p class="text-center">WHY do we go to church and worship? This is a hotly debated question in many congregations of many churches in our culture today. I was asked by a non-church attender why there are so many different denominations. It reminded me of the story of the man stranded on a desert island. It was years of just one man isolated from the civilized world, and one day a ship arrived with a rescue party to bring this poor stranded soul home. On this tiny island were three makeshift huts and the rescue leader asked what these huts were for. The castaway answered, “Well this hut is my home, I live here, and this hut over here is my church.”
